## Getting Started

Before running the frontend application, ensure that you have installed the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the web application in your default web browser.

## Development

- Add your components, pages, and styles within the `src` directory.
- Make API requests and integrate with the backend as needed.
- Configure routes and navigation in `src/App.js`.
- Create unit tests for your components and services.

## Deployment

When you are ready to deploy the frontend, build the production-ready version of the application with:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized build will be created in the `build` directory, which you can then serve using a web server or deploy to a hosting platform.
